# Assessment For Front-End Developer

Please clone or zip the angular application. 
Then run on command prompt or any other command line interpreter (powershell):
#### > **npm install**

Also install
#### > **npm install -g json-server --save**

A json-server must be running concurrently with the angular application.
Run the json-server with the following command on command prompt or any other command line interpreter (powershell):
#### > **json-server --watch creditcards.json**

Run the cloned or zipped angular application
#### > **ng serve**

Every credit card post adds to the creditcards.json file.

Thanks
